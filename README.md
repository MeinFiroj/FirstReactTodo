## 🤔 Why I Built This

I know this project is very basic and may not be super useful — but I wanted to **put myself out there**, show what I’ve learned, and be proud of taking my first step into React development. 🙌

Sharing this small project helps me track my progress and hopefully motivates others who are just getting started.
